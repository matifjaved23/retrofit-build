# Building Retrofit Recommendation System - Project Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based recommendation system for suggesting energy-efficient retrofits across different building components. The system uses historical data to train predictive models and provides specific recommendations for upgrading building components to improve energy efficiency.

## Components Analyzed
- Windows
- Walls
- Roof and Floor
- Shade
- Air Tightness
- HVAC
- Lights

## Technical Implementation
The system uses a Streamlit web application with scikit-learn models for prediction. Key technical features include:
- Random Forest classifiers for each building component
- One-hot encoding of categorical features
- Model persistence using joblib and pickle
- Interactive visualization with matplotlib

## Issues Fixed Throughout Development

### Data Processing Issues
1. **Component Name Mismatches**
   - Fixed inconsistency between code references ('Roof') and actual Excel sheet name ('Roof and Floor')
   - Updated all component references to match Excel sheet names exactly

2. **Column Name Mismatches**
   - Enhanced column name mapping to match exact names from the Excel file
   - Implemented case-insensitive matching for robustness

3. **Empty DataFrame Handling**
   - Added robust error handling for when DataFrames are empty
   - Implemented contingencies for missing categorical columns
   - Added debugging code to identify exact column names in the dataset

### Model Training Issues
1. **Unnecessary Model Retraining**
   - Fixed issue where models were retraining on every category change in the UI
   - Implemented model persistence by saving trained models to disk
   - Created a `train_models()` function that only runs once when models don't exist

2. **Prediction Quality Issues**
   - Removed vague "Other Strategies" category from predictions completely
   - Enhanced prediction confidence display
   - Implemented proper sorting of recommendations by probability

### UI and Visualization Improvements
1. **Interactive Component Selection**
   - Added dropdown for selecting building components
   - Implemented dynamic UI updates based on component selection

2. **Result Visualization**
   - Implemented bar charts for prediction probabilities
   - Added color-coding for better visual representation of confidence levels
   - Enhanced layout for better user experience

## Current System Capabilities
- Loads and processes building retrofit data from Excel files
- Trains separate ML models for each building component
- Provides specific retrofit recommendations with confidence levels
- Visualizes recommendations in an easy-to-understand format
- Persists models to avoid unnecessary retraining
- Handles edge cases gracefully with robust error management

## Future Improvements
- Further refinement of prediction models
- Additional building components and retrofit strategies
- Enhanced visualization options
- User feedback incorporation for model improvement
